        The Iliad (Book I, excerpt)
By Homer (Trans. Alexander Pope)

Achilles wrath, to Greece the direful spring
Of woes unnumberd, heavenly goddess, sing!
That wrath which hurld to Plutos gloomy reign
The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;
Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,
Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.
Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,
Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove.

Declare, O Muse! in what ill-fated hour
Sprung the fierce strife, from what offended power?
Latonas son a dire contagion spread,
And heapd the camp with mountains of the dead;
The king of men his reverent priest defied,
And for the kings offence the people died.

For Chryses sought with costly gifts to gain
His captive daughter from the victors chain.
Suppliant the venerable father stands;
Apollos awful ensigns grace his hands:
By these he begs; and lowly bending down,
Extends the sceptre and the laurel crown.

He sued to all, but chief implored for grace
The brother-kings, of Atreus royal race.
"Ye kings and warriors! may your vows be crownd,
And Troys proud walls lie level with the ground.
May Jove restore you when your toils are oer
Safe to the pleasures of your native shore.
But, oh! relieve a wretched parents pain,
And give Chryseïs to these arms again."

The Greeks, in shouts, their joint assent declare,
The priest to reverence, and release the fair.
Not so Atrides; he, with kingly pride,
Repulsed the sacred sire, and thus replied:
"Hence on thy life, and fly these hostile plains,
Nor ask, presumptuous, what the king detains.
Hence, with thy laurel crown, and golden rod;
Nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god.
Mine is thy daughter, priest, and shall remain;
Till time and conquest crown my vows with gain."

The trembling priest along the shore returnd,
And in the anguish of a father mournd.
To Phoebus then, with fervent prayer, he cried:
"Hear, god of silver bow, thy priests sad prayer!
If eer with wreaths my temple I have hung,
Or fed with flames the fat of bulls and sheep,
Avenge thy servant, and a nations wrong!"
Thus Chryses prayd; the listening godhead hears,
And from Olympus height his bow he bears.
His silver bow, and deadly shafts, he drew,
And swift as thought the fiery arrows flew.
The mules and dogs in silent death lay spread,
And last, the vengeful arrows smote the host.
Nine days the fatal darts, by Phoebus sent,
Raged in the camp, and slew the soldier tenth.
